We present a system for fast online learning of occupancy grid maps requiring low computational resources. It combines a robust scan matching approach using a LIDAR system with a 3D attitude estimation system based on inertial sensing. By using a fast approximation of map gradients and a multi-resolution grid, reliable localization and mapping capabilities in a variety of challenging environments are realized. Multiple datasets showing the applicability in an embedded hand-held mapping system are provided. We show that the system is sufﬁciently accurate as to not require explicit loop closing techniques in the considered scenarios. The software is available as an open source package for ROS.},

	abstract = {Accurate localization estimation in a global or local frame is needed for a navigation solution which results in safe and efficient vehicle guidance. SLAM is a common approach to vehicle localization in GPS denied environments, but solutions often require odometry that may not be available to UAVs. ICP and Hector SLAM are common approaches for vehicle localization that rely on scan matching without the need for odometry, however both suffer when operating in long corridors with limited features for 2D single laser LiDAR scan matching. The present work injected localization solutions for the ICP method with known pose while the vehicle injection rate to velocity ratio was varied to explore their effects on average cross track error, accumulated position error, and to compare to Hector SLAM, another common method for scan matching based SLAM. The impact of the present work is that there has been an investigation on how vehicle velocity and known pose injection rate effect cumulative localization accuracy using scan matching ICP based SLAM techniques. Performance was measured using the cross track error and accumulative position error of ICP and Hector SLAM when compared to known vehicle position in simulation. Results may be used to identify system constraints such as maximum vehicle velocity for a successful mission completion given a known position injection rate and acceptable localization error.},

	abstract = {The accurate three-dimensional road surface information is highly useful for health assessment and maintenance of roads. It is basic information for further analysis in several applications including road surface settlement, pavement condition assessment and slope collapse. Mobile LiDAR system (MLS) is frequently used now a days to collect detail road surface and its surrounding information in terms three-dimensional (3D) point cloud. Extraction of road surface from volumetric point cloud data is still in infancy stage because of heavy data processing requirement and the complexity in the road environment. The extraction of roads especially rural road, where road-curb is not present is very tedious job especially in Indian roadway settings. Only a few studies are available, and none for Indian roads, in the literature for rural road detection. The limitations of existing studies are in terms of their lower accuracy, very slow speed of data processing and detection of other objects having similar characteristics as the road surface. A fast and accurate method is proposed for LiDAR data points of road surface detection, keeping in mind the essence of road surface extraction especially for Indian rural roads. The Mobile LiDAR data in XYZI format is used as input in the proposed method. First square gridding is performed and ground points are roughly extracted. Then planar surface detection using mathematical framework of principal component analysis (PCA) is performed and further road surface points are detected using similarity in intensity and height difference of road surface pointe in their neighbourhood.
A case study was performed on the MLS data points captured along wide-street (two-lane road without curb) of 156m length along rural roadway site in the outskirt of Bengaluru city (South-West of India). The proposed algorithm was implemented on the MLS data of test site and its performance was evaluated it terms of recall, precision and overall accuracy that were 95.27\%, 98.85\% and 94.23\%, respectively. The algorithm was found computationally time efficient. A 7.6 million MLS data points of size 27.1MB from test site were processed in 24 minutes using the available computational resources. The proposed method is found to work even for worst case scenarios, i.e., complex road environments and rural roads, where road boundary is not clear and generally merged with road-side features.},

	abstract = {The roughness spectrum (i.e., the power spectral density) is a derivative of digital terrain models (DTMs) that is used as a surface roughness descriptor in many geomorphological and physical models. Although light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become one of the main data sources for DTM calculation, it is still unknown how roughness spectra are affected when calculated from different LiDAR point clouds, or when they are processed differently. In this paper, we used three different LiDAR point clouds of a 1 m × 10 m gravel plot to derive and analyze the roughness spectra from the interpolated DTMs. The LiDAR point clouds were acquired using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and laser scanning from both an unmanned aerial vehicle (ULS) and an airplane (ALS). The corresponding roughness spectra are derived first as ensemble averaged periodograms and then the spectral differences are analyzed with a dB threshold that is based on the 95\% confidence intervals of the periodograms. The aim is to determine scales (spatial wavelengths) over which the analyzed spectra can be used interchangeably. The results show that one TLS scan can measure the roughness spectra for wavelengths larger than 1 cm (i.e., two times its footprint size) and up to 10 m, with spectral differences less than 0.65 dB. For the same dB threshold, the ULS and TLS spectra can be used interchangeably for wavelengths larger than about 1.2 dm (i.e., five times the ULS footprint size). However, the interpolation parameters should be optimized to make the ULS spectrum more accurate at wavelengths smaller than 1 m. The plot size was, however, too small to draw particular conclusions about ALS spectra. These results show that novel ULS data has a high potential to replace TLS for roughness spectrum calculation in many applications.},

A novel approach to create more accurate and detailed Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) integrates LiDAR-derived elevations of dry surfaces, water depth of wetted areas derived from aerial photos and a predictive depth–colour relationship. This method was applied in three different sub-reaches of a northeastern Italian gravel-bed river (Brenta) before and after flood events occurred in November and December 2010 (recurrence interval: 8 and 10 years). From the data collected through channel field survey, a regression model which calculates channel depths using the correct intensity of three colour bands was implemented. LiDAR and depth points were merged and interpolated into a DTM which features an average error of ±18 cm. The morphological evolution and the sediment volume change calculated through a difference of DTMs shows deposition and erosion areas, indicating a deficit which reduces as it goes downstream.},

The lidar scans were taken with a 480×360 resolution at 2Hz, while driving roughly 0.3-0.4 meters per second; therefore, one of the challenges in using this dataset is to compensate for the motion distortion present in the data (resulting from the ‘rolling-shutter’ effect).

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Land-based mobile mapping systems have yielded an enormous time saving in capturing road networks and their surrounding. However, the manual extraction of the road information from the mobile mapping data is still a time-consuming task. This paper presents ARVEE (Automated Road Geometry Vectors Extraction Engine), a robust automatic road geometry extraction system developed by Absolute Mapping Solution Inc. (AMS). The extracted road information includes 3D continuous lane lines, road edges as well as lane lines attributes. There are three innovations in this work. First, all the visible lane lines in the georeferenced image sequences are extracted, instead of only extracting the central lane line or the nearby lane line pair. Second, lane line attributes are recognized, so the output is a functional description of the road geometry. Third, the output is an absolute-georeferenced model of lane lines in mapping coordinates, and is directly compatible to GIS databases. ARVEE includes four steps: First, extracting linear features in each image. Second, extracting, filtering and grouping linear features into lane line segments (LLS) based on their geometric and radiometric characteristics. Third, linking the LLSs into long lane lines 3D model using Multiple-Hypothesis Analysis (MHA). Finally, classifying each lane line into a lane line type based on the synthetic analysis of the included LLSs ’ features. The system has been tested on large number of VISAT ™ mobile mapping data. The experiments on massive real MMS data sets demonstrate that ARVEE can deliver accurate and robust 3D continuous functional road geometry model. Full automatic processing result from ARVEE can replace most of the human efforts in road geometry modelling. 1.},

of Gaussian filtering to detect the curb; solving the travelling salesman problem to form a closed polygon of the curb and point-inpolygon

	abstract = {Comprehensive and accurate information on the conditions of the road infrastructure is essential for effective management and planning of the road network, especially in cities facing serious traffic congestion problems, as in the city of Istanbul, Turkey. One of the most important services of the local authorities is the rehabilitation of road surfaces. Asphalt resurfacing is carried out to renew the road surface and restore its resistance to weathered and traffic worn pavements. Today, the determination of pavement surface conditions is usually carried out through visual inspections by the experts and interpretation of in situ photographs/videos. In this study, an investigation has been made to understand the spectral behaviour of the asphalt in terms of its contents and age, also to discover the feasibility of using widely available satellite sensors in the determination of road surface conditions. Two datasets in the study area from D‐100 road and TEM highway were used to examine asphalt road aging and deterioration. The changes to the conditions of the roads were detected using multispectral IKONOS images and ground spectral measurements for asphalt samples were obtained using an Analytical Spectral Devices full range (ASD FR) instrument in a laboratory environment. It was found that the road deformations mainly occur in areas where vehicles reduce or increase their speeds suddenly. Road sections just before toll booths and junctions are found to be more prone to deformations. IKONOS images can be effectively used to determine the condition of the asphalt pixels.},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {Mobile lidar system is a cost-effective way to acquire spatial data in the urban area effectively. It can be used to generate a detailed street-level road model. As the need for Location Based Service (LBS) is increasing, the demand of understanding the city structure is growing up rapidly as well. For this reason, street-level road model is one of the most important elements to connect the geospatial objects in the urban area. The purpose of this paper is to extract the 3D road points and road marks from mobile lidar system effectively. The major works include road points selection and road marks extraction. In the road points selection, we select the lowest point as potential ground points from all points using elevation threshold. Then, we use the cubic curve fitting and point-to-curve distance to extract road points. It can remove non-ground points like cars and pedestrians. In the road marks extraction, we generate an intensity image by the interpolation of lidar intensity and create the road marking template for matching. Then, we extract location of road marks from the point clouds based on SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) matching. The test data acquired by Riegl VMX-250 system is located in Chiu-Chung Road in Taipei city. The accuracy of data is better than 10cm. The pixel size of intensity image is 7.5cm. The experiment results show that this method can extract ground points correctly. However, only limited road mark can be found in the preliminary result. The descriptors of the keypoints have a great effect on performance in matching.},

This work seeks the GIS update starting from color images and using preexisting vectorial information. As input data only the RGB bands of a satellite or aerial color image of high resolution is required. The system includes four different modules: data preprocessing; binary segmentation based on three levels of texture statistical evaluation; automatic vectorization by means of skeletal extraction; and finally a module for system evaluation. In the first module the color image is rectified and geo-referenced. The second module uses a new technique, named Texture Progressive Analysis (TPA), in order to obtain the segmented binary image. The TPA technique is developed in the evidence theory framework, and it consists in fusing information streaming from three different sources for the image. In the third module the obtained binary image is vectorized using an algorithm based on skeleton extraction techniques and morphological methods. The result is an extracted road network which is defined as a structural set of elements geometrically and topologically corrects. The fourth module is an evaluation of the procedure using a popular method. Experimental results show that this method is efficient in extracting and defining road networks from high resolution satellite and aerial imagery.},

The Mobile Mapping System can obtain a large amount of points with traveling at a standard speed. However, in the case that the high-end laser scanning system is equipped, the distribution density of points is uneven. In the point-based method, this situation causes the problem to the method of calculating geometric information using neighborhood points. In this paper, we propose a line-based region growing method in order to detect planar structures with precise boundary from point clouds with uneven distribution density of points. The precise boundary of a planar structure is maintained by appropriately creating line segments from the input clouds. We adapt the deﬁnition of neighborhood and the estimation of the normal vector to the line-based region growing. The evaluation by comparing our result with manually extracted points shows that more than 98\% of curb points are detected. And, about 90\% of the boundary points between a road and a curb are detected with less than 0.005 meters of the distance error.},

	abstract = {Estimating the traversability of rough terrain is a critical task for an outdoor mobile robot. While classifying structured environment can be learned from large number of training data, it is an extremely difficult task to learn and estimate traversability of unstructured rough terrain. Moreover, in many cases information from a single sensor may not be sufficient for estimating traversability reliably in the absence of artificial landmarks such as lane markings or curbs. Our approach estimates traversability of the terrain and build a 2D probabilistic grid map online using 3D-LIDAR and camera. The combination of LIDAR and camera is favoured in many robotic application because they provide complementary information. Our approach assumes the data captured by these two sensors are independent and build separate traversability maps, each with information captured from one sensor. Traversability estimation with vision sensor autonomously collects training data and update classifier without human intervention as the vehicle traverse the terrain. Traversability estimation with 3D-LIDAR measures the slopes of the ground to predict the traversability. Two independently built probabilistic maps are fused using Bayes' rule to improve the detection performance. This is in contrast with other methods in which each sensor performs different tasks. We have implemented the algorithm on a UGV(Unmanned Ground Vehicle) and tested our approach on a rough terrain to evaluate the detection performance.},

In this paper, we present an algorithm which has been developed for extracting left and right road edges from terrestrial mobile LiDAR data.

The parameters involved in the algorithm are selected empirically and are fixed for all the road sections. We have developed a novel way of initialising the snake model based on the navigation information obtained from the mobile mapping vehicle. We tested our algorithm on different types of road sections representing rural, urban and national primary road sections. The successful extraction of road edges from these multiple road section environments validates our algorithm.

How to extract various road edges fast and robustly is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a fast and robust algorithm for the automatic road edges extraction from terrestrial mobile LiDAR data. The algorithm is based on a key observation: most roads around edges have difference in elevation and road edges with pavement are seen in two different planes. In our algorithm, we firstly extract a rough plane based on RANSAC algorithm, and then multiple refined planes which only contains pavement are extracted from the rough plane. The road edges are extracted based on these refined planes. In practice, there is a serious problem that the rough and refined planes usually extracted badly due to rough roads and different density of point cloud. To eliminate the influence of rough roads, the technology which is similar with the difference of DSM (digital surface model) and DTM (digital terrain model) is used, and we also propose a method which adjust the point clouds to a similar density to eliminate the influence of different density. Experiments show the validities of the proposed method with multiple datasets (e.g. urban road, highway, and some rural road). We use the same parameters through the experiments and our algorithm can achieve real-time processing speeds.},

In this paper, we propose to rearrange 3D lidar data into a new organized form to construct direct spatial relationship among point cloud, and put forward new features for real-time road detection tasks. Our model works based on two prerequisites: (1) Road regions are always flatter than non-road regions. (2) Light travels in straight lines in a uniform medium. Based on prerequisite 1, we put forward difference-between-lines feature, while ScanID density and obstacle radial map are generated based on prerequisite 2. According to our method, we construct an array of structures to store and reorganize 3D input firstly. Then, two novel features, difference-between-lines and ScanID density, are extracted, based on which we construct a consistency map and an obstacle map in Bird Eye View (BEV). Finally, the road region is extracted by fusing these two maps and refinement is used to polish up our outcome. We have carried out experiments on the public KITTI-Road benchmark, achieving one of the best performances among the lidar-based road detection methods. To further prove the efficiency of our method on unstructured road, the visual outcomes in rural areas are also proposed.},

This way, the system is able to dynamically adjust the geometric model used within a particle filter framework for both detection and estimation of the road network's geometry. The estimation process makes use of edge- and region-based image features as well as obstacle information, all supplied by the dense terrain map. Instead of tuning the likelihood functions used within the particle filter's cue fusion concept by hand, as commonly done, we apply supervised learning techniques to derive an appropriate weighting of all features. We finally show that the proposed approach enables our ground robot MuCAR-3 to autonomously navigate on rural- and dirt-road networks.},

	abstract = {Pole-like structures (PLSs) located in road environment are important roadway assets. They play a vital role in road safety inspection and road planning. The use of light detection and ranging (lidar) based mobile mapping technology for mapping of PLSs is an important area of research as it holds the potential for automation. Point cloud data of rural, peri-urban, and urban road environment are used in this study, which pose special challenge in view of the complexity of terrain, unlike well-planned roads, which have been the subject of interest in existing literature for identification of PLSs. A new five-step method is proposed in this article. The first two steps, i.e. ground filtering and voxelization of filtered non-ground points, are used for data size reduction. Next three steps are used to extract PLSs from reduced data. The proposed method was tested on point cloud data of three test sites having different levels of complexities. PLSs including partially occluded pole, tilted pole, pole situated very close to other objects, and vertical pole attached to tilted pole were accurately identified. Average correctness and completeness, respectively of 92.6\% and 94.9\%, were achieved in three different complex test sites, i.e. urban, peri-urban, and rural sites, respectively. Computation complexity shows that our proposed method delivers fast and computationally efficient solution for identifying the PLSs from volumetric mobile lidar point cloud. Impact of PLSs on road safety and road planning is also addressed for these selected test sites.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) data of roadways are frequently used for extraction of detailed roadway information which is essential for several planning and engineering applications. Recent past has seen rapid growth in utilization of mobile LiDAR system (MLS) to acquire volumetric 3D data of roadway for this purpose. MLS data are capable of capturing highly detailed road information, which is useful for road maintenance and road safety operations. The existing literature shows that road environment complexity, unevenness, and absence of raised curb limit the extraction of road information from MLS data. It must be noted that a large number of roads, especially in developing world, are characterized by these complexities and thus raise the need for a technique which can work in these road environments. Considering the above, this paper proposes a method to extract road information, where road boundary is not geometrically well-defined. The proposed method is constructed using unstructured MLS data as input and does not require any other additional data. The method is divided into three major steps, that is, MLS data structuring and ground filtering, road surface point extraction, and road boundary refinement. The first step filters ground points from input MLS data, while the second step identifies road surface points from among the ground points. The second step is designed using specific characteristics of a road, that is, topology, surface roughness, and variation of point density. Third step refines road boundary. Three test sites, quite complex with heterogeneous characteristics, were used for demonstration of the proposed method. Road surfaces of these three roadways were accurately extracted without being affected by on-road objects and absence of raised curb. Average accuracy measures like completeness, correctness, and quality were found to be 93.8\%, 98.3\%, and 92.3\%, respectively, in three test sites. Further, road boundaries of extracted road surfaces of these three test sites were refined at average completeness, correctness, and quality of 95.6\%, 97.9\%, and 93.7\%, respectively. The proposed method has shown satisfactory performance for complex roadways having road section with and without raised curb, and has potential to be employed for such road environments, which are not uncommon. Proposed method was implemented on GPU-based parallel computing framework, which significantly saved the run time in processing of MLS data of three test sites.},

	abstract = {The existing roadway infrastructures are mostly archived with two-dimensional (2D) drawings that lack the possibility for three-dimensional (3D) interpretation and advanced 3D analysis. The mobile LiDAR system (MLS) is gaining popularity in 3D mapping applications along various types of road corridors. MLS achieves the highest data quality and completeness among the traditional roadway data collection methods. The rural roads in different countries especially in India form a substantial portion of the road network. Therefore the proper maintenance and road safety analysis of rural roads are recommended activity, which could be addressed using detailed 3D road surface information. The absence of raised curb at road boundary, and presence of complexity, heterogeneity and occlusions along the rural roadway settings restrict the use of existing studies for road surface extraction using MLS point cloud data. Therefore considering the above requirement, this research paper proposes a two-stage method. The first stage extract planar ground surfaces which are further used to filter road surface in the second stage. Global properties of road, that is, topology and smoothness and its radiometric response to laser beam of MLS are used in the second stage. MLS point cloud data of rural roadway were used to test the proposed method. The road surface points were accurately extracted without being affected by the absence of raised curb and hanging objects over the road surface, that is, tree canopies and overhead power lines. The quantitative assessment of the proposed method was performed in terms of correctness, completeness and quality, which were 96.3, 94.2, and 90.9\%, respectively.},

Road lanes and traffic signs on the road surface provide safe driving for drivers and aid traffic flow movement along the highway and street. Mobile LiDAR systems acquire massive datasets very quickly in a short time. To simplify the data structure and feature extraction, it is essential for traffic management personnel to apply the right methods. Road lanes must be visible and are a major factor in road safety for drivers. In this study, a methodology is devised and implemented for the extraction of features such as dashed lines, continuous lanes, and direction arrows on the pavement from point clouds. Point cloud data was collected from the Riegl VMX-450 mobile LiDAR system. The alpha shape algorithm is implemented on a point cloud and compared with the widespread use of edge detection techniques applied for intensity-based raster images. The proposed methodology directly extracts three-dimensional and two-dimensional road features to control the quality of road markings and spatial positions with the obtained marking boundaries. State-of-the-art results are obtained and compared with manually digitized reference markings. The standard deviations were evaluated and acquired for intensity image-based and direct point cloud-based extractions, at 1.2 cm and 1.7 cm, respectively.},

The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new hierarchical-hybrid classification tool (HyClass) for mapping paved and unpaved forest roads with LiDAR data. Bare-earth and low-lying vegetation were also identified. For this purpose, a rural landscape (area 70 ha) in northwestern Spain was selected for study, and a road network map was extracted from the cadastral maps as the ground truth data. The HyClass tool is based on a decision tree which integrates segmentation processes at local scale with decision rules. The proposed approach yielded an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.5\%, with a confidence interval (CI) of 94.0\&ndash;97.6\%, representing an improvement over pixel-based classification (OA = 87.0\%, CI = 83.7\&ndash;89.8\%) using Random Forest (RF). In addition, with the HyClass tool, the classification precision varied significantly after reducing the original point density from 8.7 to 1 point/m2. The proposed method can provide accurate road mapping to support forest management as an alternative to pixel-based RF classification when the LiDAR point density is higher than 1 point/m2.},

	abstract = {The rapid proliferation of portable, ground-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) instruments suggests the need for additional quantitative tools complementary to the commonly invoked digital terrain model (DTM). One such metric is surface roughness, which is a measure of local-scale topographic variability and has been shown to be effective for mapping discrete morphometric features, i.e., fractures in outcrop, landslide scarps, and alluvial fan deposits, to name a few. Several surface roughness models have been proposed, the most common of which is based on the standard deviation of point distances from a reference datum, e.g., DTM panels or best-fit planes. In the present work, we evaluate the accuracy of these types of surface roughness models experimentally by constructing a surface of known roughness, acquiring terrestrial LiDAR scans of the surface at 25 dual-axis rotations, and comparing surface roughness estimates for each rotation calculated by three surface roughness models. Results indicate that a recently proposed surface roughness model based on orthogonal distance regression (ODR) planes and orthogonal point-to-plane distance measurements is generally preferred on the basis of minimum error surface roughness estimates. In addition, the effects of terrestrial LiDAR sampling errors are discussed with respect to this ODR-based surface roughness model, and several practical suggestions are made for minimizing these effects. These include (1) positioning the laser scanner at the largest reasonable distance from the scanned surface, (2) maintaining half-angles for individual scans at less than 22.5°, and (3) minimizing occlusion (shadowing) errors by using multiple, merged scans with the least possible overlap.},

Regions are determined using histogram-based data from gray-scale image. Image segmentation and spectral clustering are used for identification and rough estimation of potholes. Speed hump; on the other hand, are detected by integrating the LIDAR measurements in time, relative to the motion of the vehicle. The algorithm is implemented in C++ with Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) Library. The pothole detection system can detect potholes 1.6m to 5m away from the vehicle with 86.18 percent accuracy, while the speed hump detection system can detect speed humps at an optimal distance of 4.13m with an accuracy of 98.36 percent. Errors during the detection are due to the algorithms implemented, and hardware limitations. When the two systems are cascaded, the resulting system is reliable with 80.83 percent accuracy in pothole detection, and 98.46 percent accuracy in speed hump detection. However, this is only true if the number of potholes and speed humps to be detected are minimal. The limitation of the cascaded system is imposed by the single execution capability of the processing module.

The efficient capture of 3D point cloud data using mapping systems equipped with LiDAR eliminates the time-consuming and labor-intensive manual classification and quantity estimates. This paper proposes a methodology to map potholes along the road surface using ultra-high accuracy LiDAR units onboard a wheel-based mobile mapping system. LiDAR point clouds are processed to detect and report the location and severity of potholes by identifying the below-road 3D points pertaining to potholes, along with their depths. The surface area and volume of each detected pothole is also estimated along with the volume of its minimum bounding box to serve as an aide to choose the ideal method of repair as well as to estimate the cost of repair. The proposed approach was tested on a 10 mi-long segment on a U.S. Highway and it is observed to accurately detect potholes with varying severity and different causes. A sample of potholes detected in a 1 mi segment has been reported in the experimental results of this paper. The point clouds generated using the system are observed to have a single-track relative accuracy of less than ±1 cm and a multi-track relative accuracy of ±1–2 cm, which has been verified through comparing point clouds captured by different sensors from different tracks.},

Adequate performance and scalability were achieved through the use of 64-bit memory mapped files, regular 2D grid sorting, and parallel processing. The plethora of the spatial scales found in a TLS dataset were grouped into the “ground” model at the grid scale and per cell, sub-grid surface roughness. We used centroid-thinning to build a piecewise linear ground model, and studied “detrended” standard deviation of relative elevations as a measure of surface roughness. Two applications to the point clouds from gravel river bed surveys are described. Linking empirically the standard deviation to the grain size allowed us to retrieve morphological and sedimentological models of channel topology evolution and movement of the gravel with richer quantitative results and deeper insights than the previous survey techniques.},

	abstract = {Surveying techniques such as terrestrial laser scanner have recently been used to measure surface changes via 3D point cloud (PC) comparison. Two types of approaches have been pursued: 3D tracking of homologous parts of the surface to compute a displacement field, and distance calculation between two point clouds when homologous parts cannot be defined. This study deals with the second approach, typical of natural surfaces altered by erosion, sedimentation or vegetation between surveys. Current comparison methods are based on a closest point distance or require at least one of the PC to be meshed with severe limitations when surfaces present roughness elements at all scales. To solve these issues, we introduce a new algorithm performing a direct comparison of point clouds in 3D. The method has two steps: (1) surface normal estimation and orientation in 3D at a scale consistent with the local surface roughness; (2) measurement of the mean surface change along the normal direction with explicit calculation of a local confidence interval. Comparison with existing methods demonstrates the higher accuracy of our approach, as well as an easier workflow due to the absence of surface meshing or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation. Application of the method in a rapidly eroding, meandering bedrock river (Rangitikei River canyon) illustrates its ability to handle 3D differences in complex situations (flat and vertical surfaces on the same scene), to reduce uncertainty related to point cloud roughness by local averaging and to generate 3D maps of uncertainty levels. We also demonstrate that for high precision survey scanners, the total error budget on change detection is dominated by the point clouds registration error and the surface roughness. Combined with mm-range local georeferencing of the point clouds, levels of detection down to 6mm (defined at 95\% confidence) can be routinely attained in situ over ranges of 50m. We provide evidence for the self-affine behaviour of different surfaces. We show how this impacts the calculation of normal vectors and demonstrate the scaling behaviour of the level of change detection. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available open source software package. It operates in complex 3D cases and can also be used as a simpler and more robust alternative to DEM differencing for the 2D cases.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an automatic algorithm to detect basic shapes in unorganized point clouds. The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points. Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, for example, CAD models, we automatically obtain a representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data. Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute. Moreover, the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering.},

	abstract = {Plane segmentation is a basic task in the automatic reconstruction of indoor and urban environments from unorganized point clouds acquired by laser scanners. As one of the most common plane-segmentation methods, standard Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is often used to continually detect planes one after another. However, it suffers from the spurious-plane problem when noise and outliers exist due to the uncertainty of randomly sampling the minimum subset with 3 points. An improved RANSAC method based on Normal Distribution Transformation (NDT) cells is proposed in this study to avoid spurious planes for 3D point-cloud plane segmentation. A planar NDT cell is selected as a minimal sample in each iteration to ensure the correctness of sampling on the same plane surface. The 3D NDT represents the point cloud with a set of NDT cells and models the observed points with a normal distribution within each cell. The geometric appearances of NDT cells are used to classify the NDT cells into planar and non-planar cells. The proposed method is verified on three indoor scenes. The experimental results show that the correctness exceeds 88.5\% and the completeness exceeds 85.0\%, which indicates that the proposed method identifies more reliable and accurate planes than standard RANSAC. It also executes faster. These results validate the suitability of the method.},

In this article, we propose a flexible correspondence-based PCR method, which is initial-guess free, fast, and robust. We first decompose the full seven-parameter registration problem into three subproblems, i.e., scale, rotation, and translation estimations, based on line vectors. Then, we propose a one-point random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to estimate the scale and translation parameters. For the rotation estimation, we introduce a graduated optimization strategy into Tukey's biweight function and propose a scale-annealing biweight estimator. We evaluate the proposed method on both same-source and cross-source data. Results show that the proposed method is robust against over 99\% outliers and is one to two orders of magnitude faster than its competitors. The source code of our method will be made public.},

	abstract = {Localization and mapping are key requirements for autonomous mobile systems to perform navigation and interaction tasks. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is widely applied for LiDAR scan-matching in the robotic community. In addition, the standard ICP algorithm only considers geometric information when iteratively searching for the nearest point. However, ICP individually cannot achieve accurate point-cloud registration performance in challenging environments such as dynamic environments and highways. Moreover, the computation of searching for the closest points is an expensive step in the ICP algorithm, which is limited to meet real-time requirements, especially when dealing with large-scale point-cloud data. In this paper, we propose a segment-based scan-matching framework for six degree-of-freedom pose estimation and mapping. The LiDAR generates a large number of ground points when scanning, but many of these points are useless and increase the burden of subsequent processing. To address this problem, we first apply an image-based ground-point extraction method to filter out noise and ground points. The point cloud after removing the ground points is then segmented into disjoint sets. After this step, a standard point-to-point ICP is applied into to calculate the six degree-of-freedom transformation between consecutive scans. Furthermore, once closed loops are detected in the environment, a 6D graph-optimization algorithm for global relaxation (6D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)) is employed. Experiments based on publicly available KITTI datasets show that our method requires less runtime while at the same time achieves higher pose estimation accuracy compared with the standard ICP method and its variants.},

Secondly, the algorithm uses Mean Shift clustering method on the normal sphere to obtain the actual normal of the plane to be segmented.

	abstract = {Airborne laser scanner technique is broadly the most appropriate way to acquire rapidly and with high density 3D data over a city. Once the 3D Lidar data are available, the next task is the automatic data processing, with major aim to construct 3D building models. Among the numerous automatic reconstruction methods, the techniques allowing the detection of 3D building roof planes are of crucial importance. Three main methods arise from the literature: region growing, Hough-transform and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) paradigm. Since region growing algorithms are sometimes not very transparent and not homogenously applied, this paper focuses only on the Hough-transform and the RANSAC algorithm. Their principles, their pseudocode - rarely detailed in the related literature - as well as their complete analyses are presented in this paper. An analytic comparison of both algorithms, in terms of processing time and sensitivity to cloud characteristics, shows that despite the limitation encountered in both methods, RANSAC algorithm is still more efficient than the first one. Under other advantages, its processing time is negligible even when the input data size is very large. On the other hand, Hough-transform is very sensitive to the segmentation parameters values. Therefore, RANSAC algorithm has been chosen and extended to exceed its limitations. Its major limitation is that it searches to detect the best mathematical plane among 3D building point cloud even if this plane does not always represent a roof plane. So the proposed extension allows harmonizing the mathematical aspect of the algorithm with the geometry of a roof. At last, it is shown that the extended approach provides very satisfying results, even in the case of very weak point density and for different levels of building complexity. Therefore, once the roof planes are successfully detected, the automatic building modelling can be carried out.},

	abstract = {Scan-matching is a technique that can be used for building accurate maps and estimating vehicle motion by comparing a sequence of point cloud measurements of the environment taken from a moving sensor. One challenge that arises in mapping applications where the sensor motion is fast relative to the measurement time is that scans become locally distorted and difficult to align. This problem is common when using 3D laser range sensors, which typically require more scanning time than their 2D counterparts. Existing 3D mapping solutions either eliminate sensor motion by taking a “stop-and-scan” approach, or attempt to correct the motion in an open-loop fashion using odometric or inertial sensors. We propose a solution to 3D scan-matching in which a continuous 6DOF sensor trajectory is recovered to correct the point cloud alignments, producing locally accurate maps and allowing for a reliable estimate of the vehicle motion. Our method is applied to data collected from a 3D spinning lidar sensor mounted on a skid-steer loader vehicle to produce quality maps of outdoor scenes and estimates of the vehicle trajectory during the mapping sequences.},

By modeling measurements by surface elements, our approach allows for efficient and accurate registration and leverages online mapping and localization. The incrementally built local dense 3D maps of nearby key poses are registered against each other. Graph optimization yields a globally consistent dense 3D map of the environment. Continuous registration of local maps with the global map allows for tracking the 6D robot pose in real time. We assess the drivability of the terrain by analyzing height differences in an allocentric height map and plan cost-optimal paths. The system has been successfully demonstrated during the DARPA Robotics Challenge and the DLR SpaceBot Camp. In experiments, we evaluate accuracy and efficiency of our approach.},

	abstract = {The availability of light detection and ranging data (LiDAR) has resulted in a new era of landscape analysis. For example, improvements in LiDAR data resolution may make it possible to accurately model microtopography over a large geographic area; however, data resolution and processing costs versus resulting accuracy may be too costly. We examined two LiDAR datasets of differing resolutions, a low point density (0.714 points/m2 spacing) 1 m DEM available statewide in Pennsylvania and a high point density (10.28 points/m2 spacing) 1 m DEM research-grade DEM, and compared the calculated roughness between both resulting DEMs using standard deviation of slope, standard deviation of curvature, a pit fill index, and the difference between a smoothed splined surface and the original DEM. These results were then compared to field-surveyed plots and transects of microterrain. Using both datasets, patterns of roughness were identified, which were associated with different landforms derived from hydrogeomorphic features such as stream channels, gullies, and depressions. Lowland areas tended to have the highest roughness values for all methods, with other areas showing distinctive patterns of roughness values across metrics. However, our results suggest that the high-resolution research-grade LiDAR did not improve roughness modeling in comparison to the coarser statewide LiDAR. We conclude that resolution and initial point density may not be as important as the algorithm and methodology used to generate a LiDAR-derived DEM for roughness modeling purposes.},

	abstract = {Soil Surface Roughness (SR) provides a representation of surface variability which can be an important factor in a range of modelling applications such as surface water flow and sediment/nutrient transport. Moreover, it is a crucial parameter for interpreting backscatter characteristics of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for agricultural application such as near-surface soil moisture retrieval. SR is typically estimated using manual profiles of height variation along short transects (1 to 3m). However, this approach can be very time consuming and often only a small number of transects can be measured in this way, which may not be adequate to characterize the spatial variability of SR across the landscape. This study investigated the feasibility of utilising airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) observations as an alternative for mapping SR attributes across an agricultural environment in New South Wales, Australia. To that end, SR attributes were extracted from airborne LiDAR observations and compared with those extracted from an extensive ground survey of SR making use of manual pin-profilers. Results show that LiDAR-estimates of soil profile surface heights Root Mean Square (RMS) are both accurate (compared to manual profiles) and precise (repeatable stable estimates) for fields presenting bare or fallow conditions and either presenting no row structure or as long as the orientation of the LiDAR scan line is perpendicular to the row structure. In such cases results indicated a strong correlation between LiDAR-estimated and ground-measured RMS estimates (R2{\textgreater}0.68, p{\textless}0.05), with an RMSE better than 0.81cm and bias smaller than 0.48cm from a 400m flight altitude. Moreover, estimates produced from repeat pass LiDAR datasets were consistent and highly correlated (R2 0.98) suggesting that the approach is precise and robust, provided that key tillage parameters (i.e. presence of vegetative material and row direction) can be pre-classified. LiDAR estimates of surface height RMS were shown to be accurate enough to allow the tracking of temporal changes in surface roughness due to farming activities. In contrast, LiDAR-derived surface Correlation Length (CL) estimates were not found to be a reliable proxy of the ground-measured CL.},

Among the many factors that affect travel rates along an escape route, landscape conditions such as slope, lowlying vegetation density, and ground surface roughness are particularly influential, and can be measured using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. In order to develop a robust, quantitative understanding of the effects of these landscape conditions on travel rates, we performed an experiment wherein study participants were timed while walking along a series of transects within a study area dominated by grasses, sagebrush and juniper. We compared resultant travel rates to LiDAR-derived estimates of slope, vegetation density and ground surface roughness using linear mixed effects modelling to quantify the relationships between these landscape conditions and travel rates. The best-fit model revealed significant negative relationships between travel rates and each of the three landscape conditions, suggesting that, in order of decreasing magnitude, as density, slope and roughness increase, travel rates decrease. Model coefficients were used to map travel impedance within the study area using LiDAR data, which enabled mapping the most efficient routes from fire crew locations to safety zones and provided an estimate of travel time.},

The main objective of this study was to show the relevance of the autocorrelation length parameter used to describe the roughness of the bottom surface based on the example of seafloor postglacial forms in the Hans Glacier foreland. The resulting parameter reflects the scale of the terrain roughness, which varies between geomorphologic forms. Maps of the autocorrelation length were derived from successive tiles of the data, overlapping by 90\%. Based on this, the two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D FFT) was successively conducted, and the power spectral density and autocorrelation were calculated following the Wiener–Khinchin theorem. The thus obtained parameter describes the scale of the glacial bay seafloor roughness, which was assigned to the geomorphological features observed.},

	abstract = {The collection of time series data is an essential component in the investigation of earth surface processes. Spectral analysis of these time series can provide an invaluable insight into the behaviour of geophysical processes. Spectral analysis of a single time series produces an auto-spectrum which provides a representation of the amount variance of the time series as a function of frequency. Prior to spectral analysis, the time series should be plotted to identify the presence of any trends in the mean or the variance of the series, and to identify anomalies in the data which should be corrected. To satisfy the assumption of stationarity, any trend (in either the mean or variance) should be removed from the time series. Consequently, the probability density function of the time series should be plotted and compared with the Gaussian distribution. The final stage in preparing the time series for spectral analysis is to apply a taper to reduce spectral leakage and distortion of the auto-spectrum. Following the calculation of the periodogram, spectral estimates should be combined to reduce the variability associated with the estimates and thereby ensure that the autospectrum is more representative. Finally, confidence limits should be constructed around the spectral density function so that statistically significant spectral peaks (or troughs) can be identified.},

The proposed method partitions MLS point clouds into a set of consecutive “scanning lines”, which each consists of a road cross section. A moving window operator is used to filter out non-ground points line by line, and curb points are detected based on curb patterns. The detected curb points are tracked and refined so that they are both globally consistent and locally similar. To evaluate the validity of the proposed method, experiments were conducted using two types of street-scene point clouds captured by Optech’s Lynx Mobile Mapper System. The completeness, correctness, and quality of the extracted roads are over 94.42\%, 91.13\%, and 91.3\%, respectively, which proves the proposed method is a promising solution for extracting 3D roads from MLS point clouds.},

It also recognizes intersections with or without predictions from the navigation system. This is the first system that detects intersections in images without a priori knowledge of the intersection shape and location. SCARF uses Bayesian classification to determine a road-surface likelihood for each pixel in a reduced color image. It then evaluates a number of road and intersection candidates by matching an ideal road-surface likelihood image with the results from the Bayesian classification. The best matching candidate is passed to a path-planning system that navigates the robot vehicle on the road or intersection.

It starts with an initial rough classification into three larger categories: ground surface, objects on ground, and objects off ground. Based on a collection of characteristics of point cloud segments like size, shape, orientation and topological relationships, the objects on ground are assigned to more detailed classes such as traffic signs, trees, building walls and barriers. Two mobile laser scanning data sets acquired by different systems are tested with the recognition methods. Performance analyses of the test results are provided to demonstrate the applicability and limits of the methods. While poles are recognized for up to 86\%, classification into further categories requires further work and integration with imagery.},

To ensure the successful adoption of connected automated mobility solutions, their safety, reliability and hence the public acceptance are paramount. It is widely known that in order to demonstrate that L3+ automated systems are safer with respect to human drivers, upwards of several millions of miles need to be driven. The only way to efficiently achieve this amount of tests in a timely manner is by using simulations and high fidelity virtual environments. Two key components of being able to test an automated system in a synthetic environment are validated sensor models and noise models for each sensor technology. In fact, the sensors are the element feeding information into the system in order to enable it to safely plan the trajectory and navigate. In this paper, we propose an innovative real-time LiDAR sensor model based on beam propagation and a probabilistic rain model, taking into account raindrop distribution and size. The model can seamlessly run in real-time, synchronised with the visual rendering, in immersive driving simulators, such as the WMG 3xD simulator. The models are developed using Unreal engine, therefore demonstrating that gaming technology can be merged with the Automated Vehicles (AVs) simulation toolchain for the creation and visualization of high fidelity scenarios and for AV accurate testing. This work can be extended to add more sensors and more noise factors or cyberattacks in real-time simulations.},

Our detection approach does not depend on road marks, thus it is suitable for applications on rural areas and inner-city with unmarked roads.

	abstract = {Roughness is a dynamic property of the gravel road surface that affects safety, ride comfort as well as vehicle tyre life and maintenance costs. A rapid survey of gravel road condition is fundamental for an effective maintenance planning and definition of the intervention priorities. Different non-contact techniques such as laser scanning, ultrasonic sensors and photogrammetry have recently been proposed to reconstruct three-dimensional topography of road surface and allow extraction of roughness metrics. The application of Microsoft Kinect™ depth camera is proposed and discussed here for collection of 3D data sets from gravel roads, to be implemented in order to allow quantification of surface roughness. The objectives are to: i) verify the applicability of the Kinect sensor for characterization of different forest roads, ii) identify the appropriateness and potential of different roughness parameters and iii) analyse the correlation with vibrations recoded by 3-axis accelerometers installed on different vehicles. The test took advantage of the implementation of the Kinect depth camera for surface roughness determination of 4 different forest gravel roads and one well-maintained asphalt road as reference. Different vehicles (mountain bike, off-road motorcycle, ATV vehicle, 4WD car and compact crossover) were included in the experiment in order to verify the vibration intensity when travelling on different road surface conditions. Correlations between the extracted roughness parameters and vibration levels of the tested vehicles were then verified. Coefficients of determination of between 0.76 and 0.97 were detected between average surface roughness and standard deviation of relative accelerations, with higher values in the case of lighter vehicles.},

In this paper, and considering data from a 3D-LIDAR mounted onboard an intelligent vehicle, a 3D perception system based on voxels and planes is proposed for ground modeling and obstacle detection in urban environments. The system, which incorporates time-dependent data, is composed of two main modules: (i) an effective ground surface estimation using a piecewise plane fitting algorithm and RANSAC-method, and (ii) a voxel-grid model for static and moving obstacles detection using discriminative analysis and ego-motion information. This perception system has direct application in safety systems for intelligent vehicles, particularly in collision avoidance and vulnerable road users detection, namely pedestrians and cyclists. Experiments, using point-cloud data from a Velodyne LIDAR and localization data from an Inertial Navigation System were conducted for both a quantitative and a qualitative assessment of the static/moving obstacle detection module and for the surface estimation approach. Reported results, from experiments using the KITTI database, demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach in urban scenarios.},

First, the elevation-based signals are processed by filtering techniques to identify the road candidate region, and by pattern recognition techniques to determine whether the candidate region is a road segment. Then, the line representation of the projected signals on the ground plane is identified and compared to a simple road model in the top-down view to determine whether the candidate region is a road segment with its road-edges. The proposed method provides fast processing speed and reliable detection performance of road and road-edge detection.

First point clouds were separated into ground and non-ground parts, and ground roads were to be extracted from ground planes. Then, buildings and trees were distinguished in an energy minimization framework after incorporation of two new features. The separation provided supportive information for later road extractions. After that, we designed structure templates to search for roads on ground intensity images, and road widths and orientations were determined by a subsequent voting scheme. This local searching process produced road candidates only, in order to prune false positives and infer undetected roads, a scene-dependent Markov network was constructed to help infer a global road network. Combination of local template fitting and global MRF inference made extracted ground roads more accurate and complete. Finally, we extended developed methods to elevated roads extraction from non-ground points and combined them with the ground road network to formulate a whole network.},

Moreover, an original algorithm for road extraction has been developed. This two-step method is based on the local road shape and does not rely on the presence of curbs or guardrails. Different uses of the RanSaC algorithm are employed, for road sides rough estimation in the ﬁrst place, then for unlikely candidates elimination.

	doi = {10.1109/JAS.2019.1911459},
	abstract = {Despite rapid developments in visual image-based road detection, robustly identifying road areas in visual images remains challenging due to issues like illumination changes and blurry images. To this end, LiDAR sensor data can be incorporated to improve the visual image-based road detection, because LiDAR data is less susceptible to visual noises. However, the main difficulty in introducing LiDAR information into visual image-based road detection is that LiDAR data and its extracted features do not share the same space with the visual data and visual features. Such gaps in spaces may limit the benefits of LiDAR information for road detection. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel Progressive LiDAR adaptation-aided road detection (PLARD) approach to adapt LiDAR information into visual image-based road detection and improve detection performance. In PLARD, progressive LiDAR adaptation consists of two subsequent modules: 1) data space adaptation, which transforms the LiDAR data to the visual data space to align with the perspective view by applying altitude difference-based transformation; and 2) feature space adaptation, which adapts LiDAR features to visual features through a cascaded fusion structure. Comprehensive empirical studies on the well-known KITTI road detection benchmark demonstrate that PLARD takes advantage of both the visual and LiDAR information, achieving much more robust road detection even in challenging urban scenes. In particular, PLARD outperforms other state-of-the-art road detection models and is currently top of the publicly accessible benchmark leader-board.},

While it was developed to be employed primarily in the open, many users nowadays operate GPS receivers in less favourable conditions. We investigated the impact of varying types and degrees of forest cover overstorey on GPS data collection, accuracy and precision. While the occurrence of canopy overhead may degrade the positional precision by one order of magnitude, it is the presence of the foliage itself (leaf-on condition) that plays a major role in the signal reception and the positional accuracy. The relationship is inverse, with increasing relative canopy closure resulting in decreasing logging efficiency and accuracy. We also found that under larger forest canopy the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) values may improve signal reception without deteriorating accuracy. Moreover, the relationship between degree of canopy closure and the accuracy RMSE follows an exponential pattern with small increases in relative canopy closure leading to huge increases in positional error. Averaging proved to be a powerful way to diminish residual positional error under forest cover, 300 fixes being proposed as a good number for GPS data acquisition under mature canopy conditions. Ultimately, we judged that PDOP is not as good an indicator for positional accuracy under forest canopy as is universally acclaimed.}},

	abstract = {An automated animal location system, based on Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, is being used for wildlife research. The GPS is a divergent technology, and positional accuracies vary between millimeters and tens of meters, depending on the system used and operating conditions. Before GPS-based tracking data can be used for habitat analyses, the influence of habitat on GPS-collar performance must be evaluated under various canopy conditions, including the optimal condition of no canopy. We evaluated performance of nondifferentially corrected GPS collars in an experimental forest with mature, evenly spaced trees and on wild free-ranging moose (Alces alces) to determine the influence of canopy on positional accuracy and observation rate. In an experimental forest with mature, evenly spaced trees (henceforth called spacing trial), canopy characteristics of tree species, spacing, height, basal diameter, and canopy closure had no influence on positional accuracy (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but had an influence on GPS observation rate (P {\textless} 0.001). Location error was greater if positions were based on 2-dimensional rather than 3-dimensional mode of operation (P {\textless} 0.001), with location errors of 65.5 and 45.5 m, respectively. Location error in 3-dimensional mode did not differ from the expected error of 40 m (P = 0.43). As tree density increased, observation rate decreased and the probability of the GPS receiver operating in 2-dimensional mode increased (P {\textless} 0.001), resulting in increased location error. With future development of differentially corrected GPS collars, location errors of {\textless}10 m are expected.},

They have been used extensively in object reconstruction, inspection, medical application, and localization of mobile robotics. We focus on mobile robotics applications in which point clouds are to be registered. While the underlying principle of those algorithms is simple, many variations have been proposed for many different applications. In this review, we give a historical perspective of the registration problem and show that the plethora of solutions can be organized and differentiated according to a few elements. Accordingly, we present a formalization of geometric registration and cast algorithms proposed in the literature into this framework. Finally, we review a few applications of this framework in mobile robotics that cover different kinds of platforms, environments, and tasks. These examples allow us to study the specific requirements of each use case and the necessary configuration choices leading to the registration implementation. Ultimately, the objective of this review is to provide guidelines for the choice of geometric registration configuration.},

For the task of mapping with autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), we have developed a light-weight 3D laser scanner. Since the laser scanner is rotated quickly for fast omnidirectional obstacle perception, the acquired point clouds are particularly sparse and registration becomes challenging. In this paper, we present a thorough experimental evaluation of registration algorithms in order to determine the applicability of both the scanner and the registration algorithms. Using the estimated poses of the MAV, we aim at building local egocentric maps for both collision avoidance and 3D mapping. We use multiple metrics for assessing the quality of the different pose estimates and the quality of the resulting maps. In addition, we determine for all algorithms optimal sets of parameters for the challenging data. We make the recorded datasets publicly available and present results showing both the best suitable registration algorithm and the best parameter sets as well as the quality of the estimated poses and maps.},

This very low output dimension allows for near realtime correspondence search with 0.1 ms per feature point on a standard PC. Our approach is sensor- and sceneagnostic because of SDV, LRF and learning highly descriptive features with fully convolutional layers.

The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points. Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, for example, CAD models, we automatically obtain a representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data. Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute. Moreover, the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering.},

	abstract = {Plane segmentation is a basic task in the automatic reconstruction of indoor and urban environments from unorganized point clouds acquired by laser scanners. As one of the most common plane-segmentation methods, standard Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is often used to continually detect planes one after another. However, it suffers from the spurious-plane problem when noise and outliers exist due to the uncertainty of randomly sampling the minimum subset with 3 points. An improved RANSAC method based on Normal Distribution Transformation (NDT) cells is proposed in this study to avoid spurious planes for 3D point-cloud plane segmentation. A planar NDT cell is selected as a minimal sample in each iteration to ensure the correctness of sampling on the same plane surface. The 3D NDT represents the point cloud with a set of NDT cells and models the observed points with a normal distribution within each cell. The geometric appearances of NDT cells are used to classify the NDT cells into planar and non-planar cells. The proposed method is verified on three indoor scenes. The experimental results show that the correctness exceeds 88.5\% and the completeness exceeds 85.0\%, which indicates that the proposed method identifies more reliable and accurate planes than standard RANSAC. It also executes faster. These results validate the suitability of the method.},

Traditional iterative closest point (ICP) variants highly rely on the initial parameters, and most of them cannot deal with cross-source (multisource) point clouds with scale changes. In this article, we propose a flexible correspondence-based PCR method, which is initial-guess free, fast, and robust. We first decompose the full seven-parameter registration problem into three subproblems, i.e., scale, rotation, and translation estimations, based on line vectors. Then, we propose a one-point random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to estimate the scale and translation parameters. For the rotation estimation, we introduce a graduated optimization strategy into Tukey's biweight function and propose a scale-annealing biweight estimator. We evaluate the proposed method on both same-source and cross-source data. Results show that the proposed method is robust against over 99\% outliers and is one to two orders of magnitude faster than its competitors. The source code of our method will be made public.},

Firstly, the point cloud is down sampled using Voxel Grid method. Secondly, the algorithm uses Mean Shift clustering method on the normal sphere to obtain the actual normal of the plane to be segmented.

	abstract = {Airborne laser scanner technique is broadly the most appropriate way to acquire rapidly and with high density 3D data over a city. Once the 3D Lidar data are available, the next task is the automatic data processing, with major aim to construct 3D building models. Among the numerous automatic reconstruction methods, the techniques allowing the detection of 3D building roof planes are of crucial importance. Three main methods arise from the literature: region growing, Hough-transform and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) paradigm. Since region growing algorithms are sometimes not very transparent and not homogenously applied, this paper focuses only on the Hough-transform and the RANSAC algorithm. Their principles, their pseudocode - rarely detailed in the related literature - as well as their complete analyses are presented in this paper. An analytic comparison of both algorithms, in terms of processing time and sensitivity to cloud characteristics, shows that despite the limitation encountered in both methods, RANSAC algorithm is still more efficient than the first one. Under other advantages, its processing time is negligible even when the input data size is very large. On the other hand, Hough-transform is very sensitive to the segmentation parameters values. Therefore, RANSAC algorithm has been chosen and extended to exceed its limitations. Its major limitation is that it searches to detect the best mathematical plane among 3D building point cloud even if this plane does not always represent a roof plane. So the proposed extension allows harmonizing the mathematical aspect of the algorithm with the geometry of a roof. At last, it is shown that the extended approach provides very satisfying results, even in the case of very weak point density and for different levels of building complexity. Therefore, once the roof planes are successfully detected, the automatic building modelling can be carried out.},

	abstract = {The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and its variants are a fundamental technique for rigid registration between two point sets, with wide applications in different areas from robotics to 3D reconstruction. The main drawbacks for ICP are its slow convergence as well as its sensitivity to outliers, missing data, and partial overlaps. Recent work such as Sparse ICP achieves robustness via sparsity optimization at the cost of computational speed. In this paper, we propose a new method for robust registration with fast convergence. First, we show that the classical point-to-point ICP can be treated as a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, and propose an Anderson acceleration approach to speed up its convergence. In addition, we introduce a robust error metric based on the Welsch's function, which is minimized efficiently using the MM algorithm with Anderson acceleration. On challenging datasets with noises and partial overlaps, we achieve similar or better accuracy than Sparse ICP while being at least an order of magnitude faster. Finally, we extend the robust formulation to point-to-plane ICP, and solve the resulting problem using a similar Anderson-accelerated MM strategy. Our robust ICP methods improve the registration accuracy on benchmark datasets while being competitive in computational time.},

The ability to recover the geometrical structure of visible surfaces is critical for scene understanding. Typical structured indoor or urban scenes are often represented via compositional models comprising multiple planar surface patches. The RANSAC robust regression algorithm is the most popular technique to date for extracting individual planar patches from noisy data sets containing multiple surfaces. Unfortunately, RANSAC fails to produce reliable results in situations with two nearby patches of limited extent, where a single plane crossing through the two patches may contain more inliers than the “correct” models. This is the case of steps, curbs, or ramps, which represent the focus of our research for the impact they can have on cars’ safe parking systems or robot navigation. In an effort to improve the quality of regression in these cases, we propose a modification of the RANSAC algorithm, dubbed CC-RANSAC, that only considers the largest connected components of inliers to evaluate the fitness of a candidate plane. We provide experimental evidence that CC-RANSAC may recover the planar patches composing a typical step or ramp with substantially higher accuracy than the traditional RANSAC algorithm.},

	abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced, RANSAC is capable of interpreting/ smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing and analysis conditions. Implementation details and computational examples are also presented.},

We use data augmentation to overcome the biases of the original dataset and apply transfer learning to adapt the model to new semantic labels in off-road environments. Finally, we fuse the visual and geometric features using a random forest to classify the terrain traversability into three classes: safe, risky and obstacle. We implement the algorithm on our four-wheeled robot and test it in novel environments including both urban and off-road scenes which are distinct from the training environments and under summer and winter conditions. We provide experimental result to show that our algorithm can perform accurate and fast prediction of terrain traversability in a mixture of environments with a small set of training data.},

In the context of this paper, terrain classification aims at associating terrains with one of a few predefined, commonly known categories, such as gravel, sand, or asphalt. Terrain characterization, on the other hand, aims at determining key parameters of the terrain that affect its ability to support vehicular traffic. Such properties are collectively called “trafficability.” The proposed terrain classification and characterization system comprises a skid-steer mobile robot, as well as some common and some uncommon but optional onboard sensors. Using these components, our system can characterize and classify terrain in real time and during the robot's actual mission. The paper presents experimental results for both the terrain classification and characterization methods. The methods proposed in this paper can likely also be implemented on tracked robots, although we did not test this option in our work.},

	abstract = {When a mobile robot is deployed in a field environment, e.g., during a disaster response application, the capability of adapting its navigational behaviors to unstructured terrains is essential for effective and safe robot navigation. In this paper, we introduce a novel joint terrain representation and apprenticeship learning approach to implement robot adaptation to unstructured terrains. Different from conventional learning-based adaptation techniques, our approach provides a unified problem formulation that integrates representation and apprenticeship learning under a unified regularized optimization framework, instead of treating them as separate and independent procedures. Our approach also has the capability to automatically identify discriminative feature modalities, which can improve the robustness of robot adaptation. In addition, we implement a new optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem, which provides a theoretical guarantee to converge to the global optimal solution. In the experiments, we extensively evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, in which a mobile robot navigates on familiar and unfamiliar unstructured terrains. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach is able to transfer human expertise to robots with small errors, achieve superior performance compared with previous and baseline methods, and provide intuitive insights on the importance of terrain feature modalities.},

Our robot is equipped with a low-resolution 3D LIDAR and a color camera. The data from both sensors are fused to classify the terrain in front of the robot. Therefore, the ground plane is divided into a grid and each cell is classified as either asphalt, cobblestones, grass or gravel. We use height and intensity features for the LIDAR data and Local ternary patterns for the image data. By additionally taking into account the context-sensitive nature of the terrain, the results can be improved significantly. We present a method based on Conditional Random Fields and compare it with a Markov Random Field based approach. We show that the Conditional Random Field model is better suited for our task. We achieve an average true positive rate of 94.2\% for classifying the grid cells into the four terrain classes.},

The conventional methods are susceptible to vehicle speed variations and in this paper we present a method of using Laser Measurement System (LMS) data for speed independent road type classification. Experiments were carried out with an instrumented road vehicle (CRUISE), by manually driving on a variety of road terrain types namely Asphalt, Concrete, Grass, and Gravel roads at different speeds. A looking down LMS is used for capturing the terrain data. The range data is capable of capturing the structural differences while the remission values are used to observe anomalies in surface reflectance properties. Both measurements are combined and used in a Support Vector Machines Classifier to achieve an average accuracy of 95\% on different road types.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of inter-preting the data of a 3D laser range finder. The surrounding terrain is segmented into a 2D grid where each cell can be an obstacle or negotiable region. A Markov random field models the relationships between neighboring terrain cells and classifies the whole surrounding terrain. This allows us to add context sensitive information to the grid cells where sensor noise or uncertainties could lead to false classification. Camera images provide a perfect complement to the laser range data because they add color and texture features to the point cloud. Therefore camera images are fused with the 3D points and the features from both sensors are considered for classification. We present a novel approach for online terrain classification from fused camera and laser range data by applying a Markov random field. In our experiments we achieved a recall ratio of about 90\% for detecting streets and obstacles and prove that our approach is fast enough to be used on an autonomous mobile robot in real time.},

In this paper, an approach which performs scene parsing and data fusion for a 3D-LIDAR scanner (Velodyne HDL-64E) and a video camera is described. First of all, a geometry segmentation algorithm is proposed for detection of obstacles and ground areas from data collected by the Velodyne scanner. Then, corresponding image collected by the video camera is classified patch by patch into more detailed categories. After that, parsing result of each frame is obtained by fusing result of Velodyne data and that of image using the fuzzy logic inference framework. Finally, parsing results of consecutive frames are smoothed by the Markov random field based temporal fusion method. The proposed approach has been evaluated with datasets collected by our autonomous ground vehicle testbed in both rural and urban areas. The fused results are more reliable than that acquired via analysis of only images or Velodyne data.},

It plays a key role in improving driving strategy and enhancing fuel efficiency. In this paper, a two-stage approach using multiple sensors is presented. In the first stage, a feature-based identification approach is performed using an accelerometer, a camera, and downward-looking and forward-looking laser range finders (LRFs). This produces four classification label sequences. In the second stage, a majority vote is implemented for each label sequences to match them into synchronized road patches. Then a Markov Random Field (MRF) model is designed to generate the final optimized identification results to improve the forward-looking LRF. This approach enables the vehicle to observe the upcoming road terrain before moving onto it by fusing all the classification results using an MRF algorithm. The experiments show this approach improved the terrain identification accuracy and robustness significantly for some familiar road terrains.},

A ladar sensor, which produces range images, and a color camera are used in conjunction to locate the road surface and its boundaries. Sensing is used to constantly update an internal world model of the road surface. The world model is used to predict the future position of the road and to focus the attention of the sensors on the relevant regions in their respective images. The world model also determines the most suitable algorithm for locating and tracking road features in the images based on the current task and sensing information. The planner uses information from the world model to determine the best path for the vehicle along the road. Several different algorithms have been developed and tested on a diverse set of road sequences. The road types include some paved roads with lanes, but most of the sequences are of unpaved roads, including dirt and gravel roads. The algorithms compute various features of the road images including smoothness in the world model map and in the range domain, and color features and texture in the color domain. Performance in road detection and tracking are described and examples are shown of the system in action.},

The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved.

We further introduce another descriptor, which is a modiﬁed form of the dense Daisy descriptor. Random forests are used for classiﬁcation on each descriptor. Classiﬁcation results of SURF and Daisy descriptors are compared with the results from traditional texture descriptors like LBP, LTP and LATP.

	abstract = {A new convergence calculation method of the normal distributions transform (NDT) scan matching for high resolution of grid maps is proposed. NDT scan matching algorithm usually has a good effect on large grids, so it is difficult to generate the detailed map with small grids. The proposed method employs interactive closest point (ICP) algorithm to find corresponding point, and it also enlarges the convergence area by modifying the eigenvalue of normal distribution so that the evaluation value is driven effectively for the pairing data. In addition, outlier elimination process is implemented to the scanning for sub-grid scale object. The scanning data from laser range finder (LRF) have error but its set of detected small object can be clustered to determine the center of mass (CoM) and the outlier data. The outlier commonly locates behind true points and it can be eliminated when the robot observes from other point. Experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed convergence algorithm and outlier elimination method.},

Most scan match algorithms require finding correspondences between the used features, i.e. points or lines. We propose an alternative representation for a range scan, the normal distributions transform. Similar to an occupancy grid, we subdivide the 2D plane into cells. To each cell, we assign a normal distribution, which locally models the probability of measuring a point. The result of the transform is a piecewise continuous and differentiable probability density, that can be used to match another scan using Newton's algorithm. Thereby, no explicit correspondences have to be established. We present the algorithm in detail and show the application to relative position tracking and simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM). First results on real data demonstrate, that the algorithm is capable to map unmodified indoor environments reliable and in real time, even without using odometry data.},

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

	abstract = {Today’s autonomous vehicles operate in an increasingly general set of circumstances. In particular, unmanned ground vehicles (UGV’s) must be able to travel on whatever terrain the mission offers, including sand, mud, or even snow. These terrains can affect the performance and controllability of the vehicle. Like a human driver who feels his vehicle’s response to the terrain and takes appropriate steps to compensate, a UGV that can autonomously perceive its terrain can also make necessary changes to its control strategy. This article focuses on the development and application of a terrain detection algorithm based on terrain induced vehicle vibration. The dominant vibration frequencies are extracted and used by a probabilistic neural network to identify the terrain. Experimental results based on iRobot’s ATRV Jr (Fig. 1) demonstrate that the algorithm is able to identify with high accuracy multi-differentiated terrains broadly classified as sand, grass, asphalt, and gravel.},

We present an approach that works with a single, compact camera and maintains high classification rates that are robust to changes in illumination. Terrain is classified using a bag of visual words (BOVW) created from speeded up robust features (SURF) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We present several novel techniques to augment this approach. A gradient descent inspired algorithm is used to adjust the SURF Hessian threshold to reach a nominal feature density. A sliding window technique is also used to classify mixed terrain images with high resolution. We demonstrate that our approach is suitable for small legged robots by performing real-time terrain classification on LittleDog. The classifier is used to select between predetermined gaits to traverse terrain of varying difficulty. Results indicate that real-time classification in-the-loop is faster than using a single all-terrain gait.},

Finally, the particle filter is used to smooth the curb detection result.

Automatic extraction and classification of pole-like objects can remarkably reduce mapping cost and enhance work efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a voxel-based method that automatically extracts and classifies three-dimensional (3-D) pole-like objects by analyzing the spatial characteristics of objects. First, a voxel-based shape recognition is conducted to generate a set of pole-like object candidates. Second, according to their isolation and vertical continuity, the pole-like objects are detected and individualized using the proposed circular model with an adaptive radius and the vertical region growing algorithm. Finally, several semantic rules, consisting of shape features and spatial topological relationships, are derived for further classifying the extracted pole-like objects into four categories (i.e., lamp posts, utility poles, tree trunks, and others). The proposed method was evaluated using three datasets from mobile LiDAR point cloud data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently extracted the pole-like objects from the three datasets, with extraction rates of 85.3\%, 94.1\%, and 92.3\%. Moreover, the proposed method can achieve robust classification results, especially for classifying tree trunks.},

	abstract = {Information extraction and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of buildings using the vehicle-borne laser scanning (VLS) system is significant for many applications. Extracting LiDAR points, from VLS, belonging to various types of building in large-scale complex urban environments still retains some problems. In this paper, a new technical framework for automatic and efficient building point extraction is proposed, including three main steps: (1) voxel group-based shape recognition; (2) category-oriented merging; and (3) building point identification by horizontal hollow ratio analysis. This article proposes a concept of “voxel group” based on the voxelization of VLS points: each voxel group is composed of several voxels that belong to one single real-world object. Then the shapes of point clouds in each voxel group are recognized and this shape information is utilized to merge voxel group. This article puts forward a characteristic nature of vehicle-borne LiDAR building points, called “horizontal hollow ratio”, for efficient extraction. Experiments are analyzed from two aspects: (1) building-based evaluation for overall experimental area; and (2) point-based evaluation for individual building using the completeness and correctness. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework is effective for the extraction of LiDAR points belonging to various types of buildings in large-scale complex urban environments.},

	abstract = {Robust road segmentation is a key challenge in self-driving research. Though many image based methods have been studied and high performances in dataset evaluations have been reported, developing robust and reliable road segmentation is still a major challenge. Data fusion across different sensors to improve the performance of road segmentation is widely considered an important and irreplaceable solution. In this paper, we propose a novel structure to fuse image and LiDAR point cloud in an end-to-end semantic segmentation network, in which the fusion is performed at decoder stage instead of at, more commonly, encoder stage. During fusion, we improve the multi-scale LiDAR map generation to increase the precision of multi-scale LiDAR map by introducing pyramid projection method. Additionally, we adapted the multi-path refinement network with our fusion strategy and improve the road prediction compared with transpose convolution with skip layers. Our approach has been tested on KITTI ROAD dataset and have a competitive performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The detection and recognition of unstructured roads in forest environments are critical for smart forestry technology. Forest roads lack effective reference objects and manual signs and have high degrees of nonlinearity and uncertainty, which pose severe challenges to forest engineering vehicles. This research aims to improve the automation and intelligence of forestry engineering and proposes an unstructured road detection and recognition method based on a combination of image processing and 2D lidar detection. This method uses the “improved SEEDS + Support Vector Machine (SVM)” strategy to quickly classify and recognize the road area in the image. Combined with the remapping of 2D lidar point cloud data on the image, the actual navigation requirements of forest unmanned navigation vehicles were fully considered, and road model construction based on the vehicle coordinate system was achieved. The algorithm was transplanted to a self-built intelligent navigation platform to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. The experimental results show that under low-speed conditions, the system can meet the real-time requirements of processing data at an average of 10 frames/s. For the centerline of the road model, the matching error between the image and lidar is no more than 0.119 m. The algorithm can provide effective support for the identification of unstructured roads in forest areas. This technology has important application value for forestry engineering vehicles in autonomous inspection and spraying, nursery stock harvesting, skidding, and transportation.},
